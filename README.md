- This is our submission for netlify-hashnode hackathon
- [Samuel-Aspirin👨🏼‍🍳](mailto:samuellyworld@gmail.com) and [Farsh](mailto:adetonafashola@gmail.com) built this web application in line to show how easy to set up payments with [Choice-Coin](https://choice-coin.com/), [Algo](https://www.algorand.com/) and [Stripe-API](https://stripe.com/docs/api)
- We've had too much fun building this, and we'd like to take you briefly through our thoughts and creative process.

Payment
============
Because users are able to send and receive algos and choice coins with only a smartphone or computer, Algowears is theoretically available to populations of users without access to traditional banking systems, credit cards, and other methods of payment. User can also execute a transaction by simply connecting their wallet and make instant payment for goods purchased on the platform. No debit card or personal information is required.

using card, stripe is used as the payment gateway.

using [Choice-Coin](https://choice-coin.com/) or [Algo](https://www.algorand.com/), This can be done using different wallets which is algosigner, my algowallet and algorand mobile wallet. for choice coin make sure you have the equivalent of dollars to choice coin in your wallet and already opt in to its asset id.
